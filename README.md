# Now Playing Passport

PS: This project is a Twitter API helper to connect the project below to the Twitter API.
- https://github.com/markcorrea/now-playing


Project overview:

The "passport" on the name is due to the Twitter API, which doesn't allow cross-origin accesses to its API. To make this accessible by the Now Playing project, this one was created as a key that allows this information. That's where the name came.

I've chosen Node JS with Express because, for a small project, the simplest solution, avoiding complicated environment configurations, even when time is against us.

# Technologies:

NPM
- Node Package Manager - a library that manages the available packages of node.

ECMASCRIPT 6 (2015)
- JavaScript recent updates on language, released in 2015.

EXPRESS
- Node JS library structure to make Web and API applications.

BODY-PARSER
- When data comes from the backend, its format has to be treated to JSON.

TWIT
- An independent library for Twitter API connection.

SOCKET.IO
- Enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication.

GIT
- Version control system, aiming on performance.

# Project Installation:

This project is installed using Node's Package Manager (NPM). If you don't have it on your machine yet, you can download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/;

To do so, you have to use Linux or MAC's Terminal. If you are using Windows, the command prompt won't work. I recommend downloading Git Bash.

This project contains a package.json file, which means that the necessary libraries will be installes once you type the specified command. Being so, please go to the Terminal and access the root file of your project. Once done, run "npm install".

All libraries will be installed inside the node_modules folder.

Once done, go to the terminal again and run "npm start".

Webpack will start the server and , once done, you can access it by http://localhost:8080.
